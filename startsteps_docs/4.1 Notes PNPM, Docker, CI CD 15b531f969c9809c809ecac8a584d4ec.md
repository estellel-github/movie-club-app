# Notes: PNPM, Docker, CI/CD

If another user on your project is not using `pnpm`, there are a few considerations to ensure compatibility and collaboration:

---

### **1. Using the Same Package Manager Is Recommended**

The lock file is specific to `pnpm`, so it's ideal for all contributors to use `pnpm`. This ensures:

- Consistent dependency versions across all environments.
- Faster installs using `pnpm`'s features, like deduplication and symlinked `node_modules`.

---

### **2. Specify `pnpm` in the Project**

To enforce or recommend the use of `pnpm`:

1. **Add a `pnpm` requirement in `package.json`:**
    
    ```json
    json
    Copier le code
    {
      "engines": {
        "pnpm": ">=8.0.0"
      }
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **Add instructions to the `README.md`:**
    
    ```markdown
    markdown
    Copier le code
    ## Using This Project
    This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. Install it globally:
    
    ```
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copier le code
    npm install -g pnpm
    
    ```
    

---

### **3. If Some Users Insist on Using `npm` or `yarn`**

`pnpm-lock.yaml` is not directly compatible with `npm` or `yarn`, so they will ignore it and create their own lock files. This can lead to:

- Potential version mismatches for dependencies.
- Difficulty debugging issues due to differing dependency trees.

### Workarounds:

1. **Convert the Lock File (Not Recommended)**
    
    Use tools like `syncpack` to convert `pnpm-lock.yaml` to `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`. However, this is error-prone and inefficient.
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copier le code
    npx syncpack --source pnpm-lock.yaml --destination package-lock.json
    
    ```
    
2. **Force Users to Use the Same Tool**
    
    If consistency is critical, strongly recommend or enforce `pnpm`.
    

---

### **4. Use CI/CD to Enforce Consistency**

Set up your CI/CD pipelines to run commands like `pnpm install` instead of `npm install` to ensure the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is respected during builds and deployments.

### Example `package.json` Script:

```json
json
Copier le code
{
  "scripts": {
    "ci": "pnpm install --frozen-lockfile"
  }
}

```

---

### **Summary**

To avoid problems:

- Use the same package manager (`pnpm`) across the team.
- Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` and document the requirement in your `README.md`.
- If team members insist on using `npm` or `yarn`, expect possible inconsistencies and plan additional effort to manage them.

### Vous avez dit :

ok cool. So until I implement anything CI/CD related, I can just update package.json to have PNPM as advisory engine, and let any other collaborator know that they should use pnpm for package mgmt?

### ChatGPT a dit :

Yes, that's exactly the right approach for now! Here’s how you can proceed:

---

### **1. Update `package.json` to Include `pnpm` Advisory**

Add an `engines` field to specify that `pnpm` is the preferred package manager:

```json
json
Copier le code
{
  "engines": {
    "pnpm": ">=8.0.0"
  }
}

```

This will show a warning if someone tries to install dependencies using another package manager but won’t block them.

---

### **2. Document the Requirement in `README.md`**

Add a section to your `README.md` to let collaborators know that `pnpm` is required:

```markdown
markdown
Copier le code
## Package Management

This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. Please install it globally if you don’t already have it:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm

```

Then, install dependencies by running:

```bash
bash
Copier le code
pnpm install

```

Using a different package manager (e.g., `npm`, `yarn`) may result in inconsistent dependency trees.

```yaml
yaml
Copier le code
---

### **3. Add a `.npmrc` File (Optional but Helpful)**
Create a `.npmrc` file in the project root to lock `pnpm` as the default package manager for the project. This ensures collaborators using `npm` or `yarn` will see a warning:

```plaintext
packageManager=pnpm@8.0.0

```

---

### **4. Commit the `pnpm-lock.yaml` File**

Ensure `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed to the repository so collaborators get consistent dependencies.

---

### **5. Inform Collaborators**

Let your collaborators know about this setup. They should:

1. Install `pnpm` globally.
2. Use `pnpm install` instead of other package managers.

---

By doing this, you’re setting clear expectations for the team while maintaining flexibility and avoiding unnecessary setup overhead until CI/CD is in place.
